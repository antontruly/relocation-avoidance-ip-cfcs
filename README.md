## Foreword

This repo allows one to prepare the data necessary for regression analysis of country-level innovation indicators together with their bilateral tax policy. We use a controlled foreign corporation (CFC) rule to model the policy. Under this objective, I wrote a M.Sc. in Economics thesis. In addition to the code, this repo includes the data fetched without API calls and direct HTTP requests.
